#DNS

The DNS server, a recent addition to the DEDServer, allows unrooted and unjailbroken devices to connect to the DEDServer.
First of all configure the serverMode to either local or public and enableDns to true. 
Then start the DEDServer.
Now open your device, go to wifi settings, long click on your current network and hit "Edit network settings". 
Check "show advanced options", Select "static" for the IP setting and input your server IP in the "DNS 1" field.
Close the settings, open CoC and enjoy the DEDServer without root!

Remember to run the server with administrator privileges if you want to use the DNS, otherwise it won't start!
